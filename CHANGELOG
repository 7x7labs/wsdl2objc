Branch 0.5i (6/24/2009):
 - Branch for iPhone.  To be merged back into the trunk once it has been verified as working with MacOS.
 - Now produces code that compiles correctly on the iPhone.
 - Uses NSDate rather than NSCalendarDate.
 - Uses URLConnection to make the calls to avoid multi-threaded user code.
 - Greater support for asynchronous operations.
 - Added ability for end-programmer to specify call timeouts.
 - Detects and returns internal NSErrors during the operation.
 - Detects and decodes SOAPFault results.
 - Small changes to generated SOAP XML to get it to be accepted by ASP.NET servers.
 - Change handling of decimal type to work correctly on iPhone.
 - Fixed code for handling SOAP items using Objective C reserved names and added some more possible conflict keywords.
 - ...it has been demonstrated as working for one particular iPhone app talking to one particular ASP.NET web service.  No guarantees that this is universally correct yet!
 - ...some patches may be untidy and/or inefficient.  The aim was to get something working with least possible time and effort.
 
Version 0.5 (11/11/2008):
 - iPhone compiling added to the Usage Instructions (see http://code.google.com/p/wsdl2objc/wiki/UsageInstructions )
 - Generated code will now import Foundation instead of Cocoa
 - Added an option to add a tag "Svc" to the end of the service name to avoid naming conflicts.  Use this if you're seeing "redefinition of struct" errors on compiling
 - Improved WSDL compatibility (added support for xsd:float type)

Version 0.4 (10/24/2008):
 - Improved WSDL compatibility
 - long, double, int, etc types are now processed with NSNumbers instead of needing to use malloc()/free()

Version 0.3 (9/22/2008):
 - Fixed a memory-management bug in generated code when garbage collection is turned off

Version 0.2 (9/22/2008):
 - Fixed a bug where extend objects weren't being properly serialized/deserialized
 - Implemented binding operations as NSOperation subclasses so they can be run in an NSOperationQueue in the background
 - No longer requires the web service to be consistent with namespace prefixes that were defined in the parsed WSDL

Version 0.1 (9/11/2008):
 - Initial Release
