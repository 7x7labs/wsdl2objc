The source code for iPhone application for which I adapted wsdl2objc is commercially confidential at the moment, so I can't supply any real code showing the service being used.  This is a very cut down example fragment showing how I used the service.  It's not a full blown compilable application but I hope it shows you the general idea.  In addition to the files automatically generated by the tool there are two further classes: WebService, which wraps the auto-generated interface in a slightly more friendly interface and ExampleViewController, which shows the service being used.  WebService is very simple and with a bit more effort could be auto-generated too.  The way WebService works makes it easy to have multiple outstanding calls and know which call is which when the results come in.
