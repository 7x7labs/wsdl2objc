/*This addition parses ISO 8601 dates. A good introduction: <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html>
 *
 *Parsing can be done strictly, or not. When you parse loosely, leading whitespace is ignored, as is anything after the date.
 *The loose parser will return an NSDate for this string: @" \t\r\n\f\t  2006-03-02!!!"
 *Leading non-whitespace will not be ignored; the string will be rejected, and nil returned. See the README that came with this addition.
 *
 *The strict parser will only accept a string if the date is the entire string. The above string would be rejected immediately, solely on these grounds.
 *Also, the loose parser provides some extensions that the strict parser doesn't.
 *For example, the standard says for "-DDD" (an ordinal date in the implied year) that the logical representation (meaning, hierarchically) would be "--DDD", but because that extra hyphen is "superfluous", it was omitted.
 *The loose parser will accept the extra hyphen; the strict parser will not.
 *A full list of these extensions is in the README file.
